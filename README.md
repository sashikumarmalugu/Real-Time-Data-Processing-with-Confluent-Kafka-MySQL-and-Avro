# Real-Time-Data-Processing-with-Confluent-Kafka-MySQL-and-Avro
We will build a Kafka producer and a consumer group that work with a MySQL database, Avro serialization, and multi-partition Kafka topics. The producer will fetch incremental data from a MySQL table and write Avro serialized data into a Kafka topic. The consumers will deserialize this data and append it to separate JSON files.
